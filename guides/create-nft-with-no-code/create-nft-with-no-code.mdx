## Intro

This guide explains in a couple of easy steps how to mint an NFT. 
You might wonder, why create an NFT with thirdweb and not some other platform?
Well with thirdweb you don't just own the NFT, but you also own the smart contract. **Full Control**.

When you mint an NFT on a platform, where you don't own the smart contract, this can create issues.
What will happen when the platform goes down or the platform decides to change the royalties of a smart contract.

Make sure you check whether you not only own the NFT, but also the smart contract.

Alright without further ado, let's mint an NFT.
Minting an NFT requires a couple of steps. We need to create a project in the dashboard and create an NFT Collection module inside our project. We also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with **MetaMask** or **CoinWallet**. We are gonna use Metamask, if you don't have one, you can follow [this guide](/portal/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](/dashboard) and create a project and an **NFT Collection** module. if you don't know how to do this, check out [this guide](/portal/learn/introduction).

Once you've set everything up, it's time to mint our first NFT and all we need is the dashboard!

## Minting the NFT

Click on the blue button, which says `+ Mint first NFT` in the middle of your screen or click on `+ Mint` in the top right corner. 
You should see the following screen pop-up.
Go ahead and give your NFT a name, description and upload a picture. 
After you're done, click on `+ Mint NFT` (yes it's really **that** simple!).
